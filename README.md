Description: This repository contains the solution to the Occupational Accident Insurance Competition. The project involves building a predictive model to assess and classify occupational accident risks, aiming to optimize the insurance system by accurately identifying and categorizing workers' compensation claims. The solution leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical data, identify key factors influencing accident rates, and improve decision-making processes for insurance providers.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of various insurance-related features
Implementation of machine learning models such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression for risk prediction
Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization using Grid Search and Cross-Validation
Evaluation of model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Insights into important features influencing occupational accident risks
Objective: To create a robust model for predicting the likelihood of an occupational accident, which can be used by insurance companies to provide fair and accurate risk assessments for policyholders.

Technologies Used:

Python
scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
GridSearchCV, Cross-Validation
Results: The final model achieves an accuracy of X% on test data, with a strong classification performance in both precision and recall for the prediction of occupational accident risks.
